            <br>

            Much effort has been made to ensure that the layouts in the BlueRobot Layout Reservoir appear as intended in
            CSS2 compliant browsers. The content should be viewable, though unstyled, in other web browsers. If you
            encounter a problem that is not listed as a known issue, I am most likely not aware of it. Please <span class="blue">email me</span> a
            heads-up. Your help will benefit the other five or six people who visit this site.

           
            <br>
            <span class="green">Vous pouvez déplacer la photo et le menu</span>
           
            <br>

            With the popularity of three column layouts, this layout is bound to be useful to many. You may have seen
            this technique used at <span class="blue">dynamic ribbon device</span>. In fact, this "flanking menus" technique was devised by
            BlueRobot for that site. Surprisingly, the technique has caused quite a bit of talk. The concept is simple:
            a content box with large margins is flanked by two additional (menu) boxes.

            An important benefit of this technique is the order of elements in the HTML source. Here, the order is
            essentially content, menu one, menu two. For old browsers, text-only browsers, screen-readers, and many
            alternative devices, this means that the content is displayed before the menus. And, after all, most users
            visit a page for its content.

        </div>
        <div class="div3">
            <span>Known Issues</span>
            <br>
            <br>

            This layout fails in IE4.5/Mac. That browser has poor support for CSS absolute positioning, yet it
            recognizes and executes the CSS @import statement used to hide CSS from broken browsers. Currently there is
            no known solution.
